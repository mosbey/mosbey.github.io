				<h1 id="equipment-declutter">Equipment declutter</h1>
<ul>
<li>Things that no longer serve me do not deserve space in my life. They should serve others or be recycled.</li>
<li>Clearing the data off of equipment to be retired is easier when that equipement is newer.</li>
<li>Allowing old batteries to age in place benefits no one.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="digital-declutter">Digital declutter</h1>
<ul>
<li>Holding data represents risk and reward. Holding data I no longer need represents risk without reward.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="online-footprint">Online footprint</h1>
<ul>
<li>Accounts that are not in use represent a risk and are likely to be taken over.</li>
<li>Small services (like a music store) are generally safer than platforms because they are not incentivized to build walled gardens but rather are encouraged to build interoperability.</li>
<li>Having data in platforms beholden to shareholder value represents risk as that data may be interpreted as representing a revenue stream.</li>
<li>Storing data securely and outside of the reach of monetization adds intentionality to my online presence.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="focus-in-hardware">Focus in hardware</h1>
<ul>
<li>My hardware should be in service primarily to my intent, and service to the intents of others should never usurp my intent.</li>
<li>Hardware manufacturing has a significant social and environmental impact.</li>
<li>Purchases should be performant enough to provide many years of service.</li>
<li>Purchases should strongly consider the ability to run any operating system or software I choose, reducing the odds that my hardware will be aged out by the manufacturer, or become unsupported and insecure.</li>
<li>User-serviceable hardware should have a lower environmental impact.</li>
<li>Older hardware is less power-efficient, so being able to retire and recycle old hardware is important.</li>
<li>Things for sale nearby and slow shipping are less exploitative than overnight and rush shipping.</li>
<li>Open box, refurbished, and used items responsibly sourced can be less harmful than new items.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="considerations-around-media">Considerations around media</h1>
<ul>
<li>Creators, not corporations - My budget is not unlimited, so I should focus my spending on media in a way that favors compensating the creators who make the  content I like in the most direct fashion possible.</li>
<li>Libraries are my friend. They are anticapitalist and require my support. They offer access to media in a way that minimizes cost and waste.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="personal-health-and-privacy">Personal health and privacy</h1>
<ul>
<li>Algorithmic content feeds are generally built to favor the creator of the algorithm and not me. I will avoid algorithmically-generated content, except when I have at my disposal a comprehensive set of tools to cause the resulting content feed to match my wants and desires. Where my needs diverge from the creator of the feed, I will abandon the platform.</li>
<li>Existing examples of engagement-based business models do not prioritize my health. I will avoid these models wherever possible.</li>
<li>I do not wish to be a product, so I should only choose to interact with services and providers who provide clear controls around my privacy.</li>
<li>I will use tools that provide protective privacy controls.</li>
<li>Advertisements are not my friend, and I will block advertisements wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
