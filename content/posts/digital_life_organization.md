# Equipment declutter
Things that no longer serve me do not deserve space in my life. They should serve others or be recycled.
Clearing the data off of equipment to be retired is easier when that equipement is newer.
Allowing old batteries to age in place benefits no one.

# Digital declutter
Having data I no longer need represents risk.

# Online footprint
Accounts that are not in use represent a risk and are likely to be taken over.
Small services (like a music store) are generally safer than platforms because they are not incentivized to build walled gardens but rather are encouraged to build interoperability.
Having data in platforms beholden to shareholder value represents risk as that data may be interpreted as representing a revenue stream.
Storing data securely and outside of the reach of monetization adds intentionality to my online presence.

# Focus in hardware
My hardware should be in service primarily to my intent, and service to the intents of others should never usurp my intent.
Hardware has a significant social and environmental impact.
Purchases should be performant enough to provide many years of service.
Purchases should strongly consider the ability to run any operating system or software I choose, reducing the odds that my hardware will be aged out by the manufacturer, or become unsupported and insecure.
User-serviceable hardware should have a lower environmental impact.
Older hardware is less power-efficient, so being able to retire and recycle old hardware is important.
Things for sale nearby and slow shipping are less exploitative than overnight and rush shipping.
Open box, refurbished, and used items responsibly sourced can be less harmful than new items.

# Considerations around media
Creators, not corporations - My budget is not unlimited, so I should focus my spending on media in a way that favors compensating the creators who make the content I like in the most direct fashion possible.
Libraries are my friend. They are anticapitalist and require my support. They offer access to media in a way that minimizes cost and waste.

# Personal health and privacy
Algorithmic content feeds are generally built to favor the creator of the algorithm and not me. I will avoid algorithmically-generated content, except when I have at my disposal a comprehensive set of tools to cause the resulting content feed to match my wants and desires. Where my needs diverge from the creator of the feed, I will abandon the platform.
Existing examples of engagement-based business models do not prioritize my health. I will avoid these models wherever possible.
I do not wish to be a product, so I should only choose to interact with services and providers who provide clear controls around my privacy.
I will use tools that provide protective privacy controls.
Advertisements are not my friend, and I will block advertisements wherever possible.
