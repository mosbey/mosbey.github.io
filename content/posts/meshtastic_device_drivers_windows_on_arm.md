![Windows Device Manager detail on a MeshTastic device that has an error due to no available driver.](/images/meshtastic_no_driver_windows_on_arm.png)

It's kind of unfortunate, but I've run into a problem several times flashing Meshtastic devices using a Windows on ARM computer. It seems these drivers either don't exist, or aren't available for automatic download via Windows Update. My only solution so far as been to switch to a Windows device running on x86_64.
